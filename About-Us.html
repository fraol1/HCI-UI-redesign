              Hi, we are Mark & Angie Gray and 'MGBD Parts' is the part of our
              business dedicated to keeping Rover P6 cars on the road at cost
              effective prices. We have over 30 years experience of owning,
              repairing, restoring and running Rover P6 cars in all variants,
              2000, 2200 & 3500, saloon and estate, both as everyday and show
              condition cars.
              <p>
               Our current fleet includes an everyday user 1966
              Rover 2000, and also a 1972 Rover 2000TC export, 1975 Rover 2200
              Auto, 1972 Rover 3500 Estoura (estate) and of course, the last P6
              off the production line 'VVC 700S', the avocado Rover 3500S. We
              have had over 25 years involvement in classic car clubs mostly at
              committee level and have now turned our specialist knowledge and
              experience into our Rover P6 parts business 'MGBD Parts', which is
              dedicated to supplying quality parts for all variants of the Rover
              P6 built between 1963-1977. The parts stocked are predominantly
              brand new manufactured items but there is also a mix of 'NOS' (New
              Old Stock), refurbished service exchange and second hand parts.</p>
                <p>
              But if you can't see what you need please email or call us. Also
              if you need any advice or technical help, we are only a phone call
              away and we'll be glad to help and what's more, that's free!.
              Please note that all Refurbished, NOS and Secondhand parts are
              detailed as such in the webstore, and therefore anything else
              listed is a brand new manufactured item. You can click on the
              categories list on the left of the webstore or use the product
              search facility to look through our items by description or by
              part number. To make life easier for you we have listed all of the
              parts by the original Rover parts numbers that were used in the
              Rover Parts catalogues, so you can look your part up by its Rover
              part number.</p>

               If you don't find what you are looking for, again
              please call or drop us an email. The shop also has a facility for
              you to register as a 'user' and by doing this, we can save your
              contact details for future purchases and then you'll only have to
              log in, which saves you time when you are purchasing parts. You
              can also save your 'Shopping Basket' and return at a later date if
              you need to. Registered users will be emailed periodically with
              details of our latest parts, offers and other news via the shop's
              newsletter which will start shortly, however please check out our
              'Important Customer Information' and 'Privacy' pages for the legal
              stuff. The webstore has been live since July 2012 and has new
              items being added daily and is therefore growing everyday, so you
              really do need to refresh your browser every time you visit us. We
              have set up a competitive set of shipping rates and offer combined
              shipping rates for multiple purchases but please ask if a shipping
              rate doesn't seem right for you.
